Observations
setting up environment was much faster than doing it alone
Did not use driver navigator pattern, but worked with three, don't think it would have worked with more people
We LIKE PyCharm!
Workflow for approval tests is not clear initially (Instance of Golden master pattern) - may need more detailed readme

Happy we achieved our goal
Kept goal small enough, and got there

Helpful to have someone familiar with approval tests, even in a different language

Always look at the error messages!
(Possible issue due to lack of formal structure)

We did not like the test code always emitting a warning.

Next week: Lets fix the warnings in Python Approvals Test library!
